FinalProject_Week12
Overview
This project is focused on implementing and comparing two different machine learning models to classify the Iris dataset. The project is divided into two phases:

Phase 1: A simple logistic regression model to establish a baseline performance.
Phase 2: A hybrid Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model to improve upon the baseline.


Problem Statement
The goal of this project is to classify the Iris flower species based on features like sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width. The dataset consists of three species: Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginica.

Data
The dataset used in this project is the Iris dataset, a well-known dataset in the machine learning community. It contains 150 samples, with 50 samples for each of the three species. The features include:
Sepal Length,Sepal Width,Petal Length,Petal Width
